      <p>I graduated college in 2013 with a BBA in Management and Finance from Texas State University.
      From there, I left Austin and headed to Seattle to begin a Program Manager Contract role at Amazon's HQ.
      After a few short months, I figured I wasn't ready to join the 9-5 workforce. I needed to get some traveling out of my system.
      So I headed back to Austin and couch surfed for about 6 months. I took some odd jobs to maintain cash-flow: did some work
      for a local startup, tutored elementary to high school kids, Valeted at the Austonian, which was super degrading;
      in fact, it was this job that pushed me over the edge: there was one car I went to valet (a sweet porsche), and it turned out to be a girl
      I went to high school with and her (presumably) rich boyfriend. I quit that day. After being humbled and relizing I was worth more, I moved
      back up to Seattle and took a role selling SEO on behalf of the Better Business Bureau. I quickly realized I was never going to thrive
      in the sales industry; I actually found myself pitching people in the Leonardo Dicaprio Wolf of Wall Street voice: "donny listen to me,
      I just had a stock land on my desk of a small company in the military arms division with huge upside potential and I'm calling you because
      this stock, while just a few pennies a share right now, could be worth in excess of $200 dollars in the next few months. This is not something you want to
      miss out on. How much can I lock you in for?", and whats even crazier, it actually worked... I thought, this can't be good, and proceeded to
      search for roles elsewhere. I found a fraud analyst role with Expedia, where I got my first taste of SQL, fraud and data. This job lasted about
      two years, and from then on, I was unstoppable. I realized it wasn't so much about what you knew, but more on your attitude of being able
      to learn the material. There's a learning curve to almost everything you do, so trying to become an expert in every little thing just wasn't
      feasible. What was feasible was the method of describing how well you knew something in such a way that made the employer think "I'm not even
      sure what this guy just said, but it sounds good enough for me", and that's what it's all about. Granted, I'm an expert many data related topics now, but
      you have to get in the door to learn what you need to learn... The next few years I went to a few startups, one in San Francisco, one in Scottsdale,
      made some great engineer and data science friends and ultimately found myself in this consulting role making more money than I could have dreamed of
      5 years ago. At heart I'm just an overly competitive skateboarder who wanted to learn a little about everything.
